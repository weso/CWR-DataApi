CWR file utilities.

CWR files follow the pattern CWyynnnnsss_rrr.Vxx, where each section means the following:
CW - Header indicating it is a CWR file.
yy - Year.
nnnn - Sequence. This was originally 2 numbers, later changed to 4.
sss - Sender. 2 or 3 digits.
rrr - Receiver. 2 or 3 digits.
xx - Version of the CWR standard

It should be noted that the CISAC CWR standard specification indicates that the sequence should be two digits long.
But the CWR Management Committee increased it to four.
