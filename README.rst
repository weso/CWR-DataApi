CWR Data Model API
==================

This projects offers a domain model for the CISAC CWR standard v2.1 to be
used on Python applications.

CWR stands for Common Works Registration, and it is a common or standard
format for the registration and revision of musical works, used by
publishers and performing rights societies as a way to exchange musical
works data.

While the CWR standard has been created by `CISAC`_ this library has been
developed by `WESO`_ independently, with help from `BMAT`_.

The library includes a data model for representing the contents of a CWR
file, and parsers to create that model from a file, and to decode and
encode JSON messages with the data model.
